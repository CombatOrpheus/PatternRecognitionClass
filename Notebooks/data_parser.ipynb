    "- `data{index}`\n",
    "  - **petri_net**: A compound matrix $[I; O; M_0]$ representing the Petri Net; for a Petri Net with $N$ transitions, the compound matrix will have a length of $N*2 + 1$.\n",
    "  - **arr_vlist**: The reachable markings of this Petri Net.\n",
    "  - **arr_edge**: The edges (source, destination) for the reachable markings.\n",
    "  - **arr_tranidx**: The transition that fired, leading to the creation of a new marking.\n",
    "  - **spn_labda**: The $\\lambda$ (average firing rate) of the transition.\n",
    "  - **spn_steadyprob**: The steady probability distribution of the Petri Net.\n",
    "  - **spn_markdens**: The token probability density function of the Petri Net.\n",
    "  - **spn_mu**: The average number of tokens in the network in the steady state.\n",

    "For my purposes, only the first four data points are of interest, so I'll focus on extracting them. These correspond to the *Petri Net* and the *Reachability Graph*."

Python's standard JSON module is not adequate for this because it has to read the entire file before parsing, which is wasteful. Instead, `ijson` offers a steaming alternative, which is what I will be using."
