    "# GNNs\n",
    "Similar to CNNs, which are able to exploit structural characteristics of images to improve their learning process, GNNs are suited for learning over *graph-like* data. Since Petri Nets carry essential information in their structure, using other models would not lead to useful results without some ingenious data engineering and feature extraction; GNNs allow for this process to be skipped almost entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Hybrid System with GNNs\n",
    "For this project, we need to create a hybrid system, so using GNNs to learn and extract feature vectors from the Petri Nets is going to be the first step; these feature vectors can then be used by other models to infer characteristics from the original net. But first, we need to convert the data into a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "# PyTorch Geometric (PyG)\n",
    "PyTorch Geometric is a framework atop PyTorch for the construction of GNN models: it provides several layers from literature, which can then be combined for the creation of a GNN. But first, we have to transform the data a structure that PyG accepts."
