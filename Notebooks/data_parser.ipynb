    "# Parsing the Data\n",
    "The data set is available in a JSON format, in both original and pre-processed formats. Since my needs are different from that of the original authors, I'll be using the original data. The data is organised as follows:\n",
    "- `data{index}`\n",
    "  - **petri_net**: A compound matrix $[I; O; M_0]$ representing the Petri Net; for a Petri Net with $N$ transitions, the compound matrix will have a length of $N*2 + 1$.\n",
    "  - **arr_vlist**: The reachable markings of this Petri Net.\n",
    "  - **arr_edge**: The edges (source, destination) for the reachable markings.\n",
    "  - **arr_tranidx**: The transition that fired, leading to the creation of a new marking.\n",
    "  - **spn_labda**: The $\\lambda$ (average firing rate) of the transition.\n",
    "  - **spn_steadyprob**: The steady probability distribution of the Petri Net.\n",
    "  - **spn_markdens**: The token probability density function of the Petri Net.\n",
    "  - **spn_mu**: The average number of tokens in the network in the steady state.\n",
    "\n",
    "For my purposes, only the first four data points are of interest, so I'll extract them."
