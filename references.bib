The SPN models are described in the input language for SPNP called CSPL (C-based SPN Language) which is an extension of the C programming language [8] with additional constructs which facilitate easy description of SPN models. Moreover, if the user does not want to describe his model in CSPL, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is available to specify all the characteristics as well as the parameters of the solution method chosen to solve the model.",

It supports modeling and performance evaluation of stochastic models, including extended deterministic and stochastic Petri nets, colored stochastic Petri nets, and Markov chains as well as UML extensions. Among its main characteristics are simulation and analysis modules for stationary and transient evaluation of Petri nets including non-exponentially distributed delays, as well as a simulation module for complex colored models. Recent enhancements include algorithms for the efficient rare-event simulation of Petri nets, a new multi-trajectory hybrid simulation/analysis algorithm, and a net class for Markov chains.",

	abstract = {Agent-based intelligent manufacturing control systems are capable to efficiently respond and adapt to environmental changes. Manufacturing system adaptation and evolution can be addressed with learning mechanisms that increase the intelligence of agents. In this paper a manufacturing scheduling method is presented based on Timed Colored Petri Nets (CTPNs) and reinforcement learning (RL). CTPNs model the manufacturing system and implement the scheduling. In the search for an optimal solution a scheduling agent uses RL and in particular the Q-learning algorithm. A warehouse order-picking scheduling is presented as a case study to illustrate the method. The proposed scheduling method is compared to existing methods. Simulation and state space results are used to evaluate performance and identify system properties.},

	abstract = {The existing Stochastic Petri Net (SPN) analysis methods are based on a series of steps, including generating the reachable graph, solving the state equation, etc. Unfortunately, these methods cannot perform performance analysis when the state equation has no unique solution. The end-to-end deep learning methods can build a mapping relationship from SPN to performance indicators, which avoids solving the state equation. However, there is a lack of benchmark datasets for SPN learning and training. This paper proposes an automatic generation method of SPN datasets, including SPN random generation, data labeling, data enhancement, and filtering. To relieve the local aggregation problem of random-based organization, a grid-based data organization method is proposed to ensure the diversity of the datasets. In the experimental section, the generated datasets are trained and tested on three types of neural networks. The results show that the generated benchmark datasets are useful, and the increase of dataset size will significantly improve the learning performance.}

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence is one of the hottest research topics in computer science. In general, when it comes to the needs to perform deep learning, the most intuitive and unique implementation method is to use neural network. But there are two shortcomings in neural network. First, it is not easy to be understood. When encountering the needs for implementation, it often requires a lot of relevant research efforts to implement the neural network. Second, the structure is complex. When constructing a perfect learning structure, in order to achieve the fully defined connection between nodes, the overall structure becomes complicated. It is hard for developers to track the parameter changes inside. Therefore, the goal of this article is to provide a more streamlined method so as to perform deep learning. A modified high-level fuzzy Petri net, called deep Petri net, is used to perform deep learning, in an attempt to propose a simple and easy structure and to track parameter changes, with faster speed than the deep neural network. The experimental results have shown that the deep Petri net performs better than the deep neural network.},
